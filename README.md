Eir README
==========

Eir is an IRC client bot framework, written primarily for freenode utility
functions. It is, however, highly extensible using C++ or Perl, and is used by
other projects as well.

Installation
============

If you just want to know how to build and install it, do the following

git submodule init
git submodule update
autoconf
./configure --prefix=SOMEWHERE
make
make install

Then go to SOMEWHERE/etc, and write eir.conf. There is an example config file
installed.
