COMMANDS

These may be sent in PM to the bot, or in channel by prefixing them with !
Note if you use the commands in channel the reply will be sent to the channel.

btinfo (index|nick|#channel)

  This will show you information about one ban if
  btinfo index is used.

  However, if btinfo nick is used, then it will show all the
  active bans set by the nick, and how many bans the nick has set in total.

  If btinfo #channel is used, the it will return a list of all the recorded bans
  set in a channel (warning, this may be a long list).

btcheck #channel (nick|fullMask)

  This will return a list of active bans on the #channel that match the user
  either by nick or full mask (nick will use the bot's internal list)

btpending (#channel|nick)

  This command will list all of the bans that are both active and uncommented
  for the #channel or set by the nick.

btexpired #channel

 This command will list all of the bans in #channel that are active and
 expired.


btset index [~time]|[reason]

  Sets the ban expire time and/or the reason for the ban by index.

REASONS

 When you set a ban, the bot will PM you requesting a comment on the ban. Simply
 reply to the comment, whatever you send will be recorded. If you have set more
 than one ban you will be promted for each in turn.

 If you wish to extend the default ban time (channel dependent, typically 24 hours),
 type this when you enter your comment: ~time comment - e.g. "~14d Trolling".

TIME SPECIFICATION

 When commenting or using the btset command times can be specified in days, hours, minutes, seconds or any combination.

 ~1h       For 1 hour from the time set.
 ~4h1m4s   For 4 hours, 1 minute and 4 seconds from the time set.
 ~48h      For 48 hours from the time set, (can also use ~2d).
 ~14d      For 2 weeks (or 14 days) from the time set.

ACTIONS

 The time specification can be prefixed with a single character to dictate the action that will be taken when the ban expires:

'#' Report the expired ban to the report channel only, or do nothing if there is no report channel
'@' Remove the ban if the bot has operator status, or report the ban as above
'%' Try and obtain operator status using ChanServ and remove the ban. If this is not possible no action will be taken.
